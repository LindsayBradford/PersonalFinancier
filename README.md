#Personal Financier

A budgetting and bookeeping application  done to suit my own way of doing things.

This app lication depends on the following resources:
--------------------------------------------
  * GSson (<http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/>) for Java JSon serialisation
  * JTattoo (<http://www.jtattoo.net/>) for a radically different Swing Look & Feel
  * FontAwesome (<http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome>) for icon-friendly font glyphs
